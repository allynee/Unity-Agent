Instruction:
Continuously edit the Rotation property of the array of zombies to make them lean forward and backward in a rhythmic motion, adjusting the pitch by ±15 degrees from their default orientation

Code:
private List<Object3D> zombies;

private void Start()
{
    // Find all zombies in the scene
    zombies = GetAllZombiesInScene();
    
    // Check if any zombies were found
    if (zombies.Count == 0)
    {
        Debug.LogError("No zombies found in the scene.");
        return;
    }
}

private void Update()
{
    // Check if any zombies were found
    if (zombies.Count == 0)
    {
        Debug.LogError("No zombies found in the scene.");
        return;
    }

    LeanZombiesRhythmically();
}

public void LeanZombiesRhythmically()
{
    foreach (Object3D zombie in zombies)
    {
        // Get the current rotation of the zombie
        Vector3D currentRotation = zombie.GetRotation();

        // Calculate the new rotation pitch within ±15 degrees
        float newPitch = Mathf.Sin(Time.time) * 15; // Using sine function for rhythmic motion

        // Set the new rotation of the zombie
        zombie.SetRotation(new Vector3D(currentRotation.x, currentRotation.y, currentRotation.z + newPitch));
    }
}
