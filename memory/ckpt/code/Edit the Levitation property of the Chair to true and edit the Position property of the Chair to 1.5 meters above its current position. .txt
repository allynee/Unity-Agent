Instruction:
Edit the Levitation property of the Chair to true and edit the Position property of the Chair to 1.5 meters above its current position. 

Code:
private Object3D userChair;

private void Start()
{
    MakeChairFloat();
}

public void MakeChairFloat()
{
    if (userChair== null)
    {
        Vector3D positionToCreateChair = GetUsersFeetPosition(); 
        userChair = CreateObject("UserChair", "Chair", positionToCreateChair, new Vector3D(0, 0, 0));
    }   
    // Levitate the chair by a given amount (e.g., 1.5 meters above the ground)
    userChair.Levitate(true);
    Vector3D chairPosition = userChair.GetPosition();
    userChair.SetPosition(new Vector3D(chairPosition.x, chairPosition.y + 1.5f, chairPosition.z));
}
