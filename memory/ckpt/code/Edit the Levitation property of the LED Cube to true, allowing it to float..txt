Instruction:
Edit the Levitation property of the LED Cube to true, allowing it to float.

Code:
// Declare a private field to track the LED Cube
private Object3D ledCube;

public void Start()
{
    // Find the LED Cube in the scene
    ledCube = FindObject3DByName("LED Cube");

    // Check if the LED Cube was found
    if (ledCube == null)
    {
        Debug.Log("LED Cube not found in the scene.");
        return;
    }

    // Make the LED Cube levitate
    MakeLedCubeLevitate();
}

public void MakeLedCubeLevitate()
{
    // Check if the LED Cube is already levitating
    if (ledCube.IsLevitated())
    {
        Debug.Log("LED Cube is already levitating.");
        return;
    }

    // Set the Levitate property of the LED Cube to true
    ledCube.Levitate(true);

    Debug.Log("LED Cube is now levitating.");
}
