Instruction:
Edit the Position property of the LED Cube to be 1 meter above its current position, ensuring it is floating above the table.

Code:
// Declare the LED Cube object
private Object3D ledCube;

public void Start()
{
    // Find the LED Cube in the scene
    ledCube = FindObject3DByName("LED Cube");

    // If the LED Cube is found, lift it up
    if (ledCube != null)
    {
        LiftLedCubeUp();
    }
    else
    {
        Debug.Log("LED Cube not found in the scene.");
    }
}

public void LiftLedCubeUp()
{
    // Get the current position of the LED Cube
    Vector3D cubePosition = ledCube.GetPosition();

    // Set the new position to be 1 meter above the current position
    Vector3D newPosition = new Vector3D(cubePosition.x, cubePosition.y + 1.0f, cubePosition.z);

    // Set the LED Cube to levitate
    ledCube.Levitate(true);

    // Update the position of the LED Cube
    ledCube.SetPosition(newPosition);

    Debug.Log("LED Cube has been lifted up by 1 meter.");
