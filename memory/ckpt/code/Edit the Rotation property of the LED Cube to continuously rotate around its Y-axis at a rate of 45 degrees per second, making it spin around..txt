Instruction:
Edit the Rotation property of the LED Cube to continuously rotate around its Y-axis at a rate of 45 degrees per second, making it spin around.

Code:
// Declare a private field to track the LED Cube
private Object3D ledCube;

public void Start()
{
    // Find the LED Cube in the scene
    ledCube = FindObject3DByName("LED Cube");

    // Check if the LED Cube was found
    if (ledCube == null)
    {
        Debug.LogError("LED Cube not found in the scene.");
        return;
    }
}

public void Update()
{
    // Check if the LED Cube was found
    if (ledCube == null)
    {
        Debug.LogError("LED Cube not found in the scene.");
        return;
    }

    // Get the current rotation of the LED Cube
    Vector3D currentRotation = ledCube.GetRotation();

    // Calculate the new rotation around the Y-axis
    float newYRotation = currentRotation.y + 45 * Time.deltaTime;

    // Set the new rotation of the LED Cube
    ledCube.SetRotation(new Vector3D(currentRotation.x, newYRotation, currentRotation.z));
}
