Instruction:
Edit the Rotation property of the table to continuously rotate around its Y-axis at a rate of 60 degrees per second, making it dance around.

Code:
private Object3D dancingTable;

public void Start()
{
    // Find the table in the scene
    dancingTable = FindObject3DByName("Table");

    // Check if the table was found
    if (dancingTable == null)
    {
        Debug.LogError("Table not found in the scene.");
        return;
    }
}

public void Update()
{
    // Check if the table was found
    if (dancingTable == null)
    {
        Debug.LogError("Table not found in the scene.");
        return;
    }

    // Get the current rotation of the table
    Vector3D currentRotation = dancingTable.GetRotation();

    // Calculate the new rotation around the Y-axis
    float newYRotation = currentRotation.y + 60 * Time.deltaTime;

    // Set the new rotation of the table
    dancingTable.SetRotation(new Vector3D(currentRotation.x, newYRotation, currentRotation.z));
}
