Instruction:
Edit the Size property of the lamp to be shorter and wider, with the X and Z axis adjusted to 0.8 times its original size, and the Y axis adjusted to 0.6 times its original size.

Code:
private Object3D lamp;

public void ResizeLamp()
{
    if (lamp == null)
    {
        Debug.LogError("Lamp doesn't exist. Create it first before resizing it.");
        return;
    }

    // Get the current size of the lamp
    Vector3D currentSize = lamp.GetSize();

    // Calculate the new size based on the given instructions
    float newX = currentSize.x * 0.8f;
    float newY = currentSize.y * 0.6f;
    float newZ = currentSize.z * 0.8f;

    // Set the new size for the lamp
    lamp.SetSize(new Vector3D(newX, newY, newZ));
}
