Plan:
1. Create ten new objects of type "LED Cube"
2. Get information about the wall that the user is facing
3. Edit the Position property of the array of LED cubes so they form a circle on the wall
4. Continuously edit the Illumination property of the array of LED cubes to change every 1 second, and change the Color property of each LED cube to a new randomly generated RGBA value at the same interval to create a dynamic light show
