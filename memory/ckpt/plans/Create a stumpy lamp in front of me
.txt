Create a stumpy lamp in front of me


Plan:
1. Create a new object of type "Lamp".
2. Edit the Position property of the Lamp to be 0.5 meters in front of the user.
3. Edit the Size property of the Lamp to be 0.8 times its original size on the Y axis to make it shorter.
4. Edit the Size property of the Lamp to be 2.5 times its original size on the X and Z axis to make it even fatter.
