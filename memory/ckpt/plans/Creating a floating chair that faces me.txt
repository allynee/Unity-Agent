Creating a floating chair that faces me

Plan:
1. Create a “Chair” object at the user's feet position.
 2. Position the chair to a default 2 meters in front of the user. 
 3. Set the chair to levitate 1.5 meters above its current ground position.
 4. Rotate the chair to face the user, correcting for an initial right-facing orientation of the chair by rotating it to face the user's head position.
