User query:
Creating a floating chair that faces me

Plan:
1. Create a new object of type “Chair”.
2. Edit the Position property of the Chair to a default of 2 meters in front of the user, adjusting as needed to avoid collisions with nearby objects and walls.
3. Edit the Levitation property of the Chair to true so gravity does not pull the chair down, then edit the Position property of the Chair to 1.5 meters above its current position. 
4. Edit the Rotation property of the chair to face the user, correcting for an initial right-facing orientation of the chair by rotating it to face the user's head position.
