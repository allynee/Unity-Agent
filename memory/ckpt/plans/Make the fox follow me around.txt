User query:
Make the fox follow me around

Plan:
1. Find a “Fox” object in the scene
 2. Initialize a NavMeshAgent and Animator component for the fox, setting the fox's NavMeshAgent speed to default 2.0 units/s, angular speed to 120 degrees/s, and acceleration to 8 units/s_.
 3. Continuously rotate the fox to face the user 
 4. Continuously update the fox's destination to a point 0.5 meters in front of the user's current orientation. If the fox is more than 0.7 meters away from this point, it should start walking towards it.
