User query:
Make the fox follow me around

Plan:
1. Find a “Fox” object in the scene. If there are no "Fox" objects found, create a new object of type "Fox"
2. Initialize a NavMeshAgent component for the Fox, setting the Fox's NavMeshAgent's speed to default 2.0 units/s, angular speed to 120 degrees/s, and acceleration to 8.0 units/s^2
3. Continuously edit the Rotation property of the Fox to face the user 
4. Continuously check if the Fox is more than 1.5 meters away from the user with a Boolean variable. If true, update the Fox's NavMeshAgent's destination to a point 0.5 meters in front of the user's current orientation
