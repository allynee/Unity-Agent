Place a big blue lamp on the table

Plan:
1. Create a new object of type “Lamp” 
2. Edit the Color property of the lamp to blue with RGBA(0, 0, 1, 1)
3. If a table is in view, edit the Position property of the Lamp at the center on top of the table
4. Edit the Size property of the lamp on the table to be up to 2.5 times its original size, ensuring it does not exceed the surrounding space limitations, such as the table size and ceiling height
