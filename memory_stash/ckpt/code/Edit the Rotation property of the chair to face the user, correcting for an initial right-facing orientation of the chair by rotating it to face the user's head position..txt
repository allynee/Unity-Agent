Instruction:
Edit the Rotation property of the chair to face the user, correcting for an initial right-facing orientation of the chair by rotating it to face the user's head position.

Code:
private Object3D userChair;

private void Start()
{
    RotateChairToFaceUser();
}

public void RotateChairToFaceUser()
{
    if (userChair== null)
    {
        Vector3D positionToCreateChair = GetUsersFeetPosition(); 
        userChair = CreateObject("UserChair", "Chair", positionToCreateChair, new Vector3D(0, 0, 0));
    }   

    // Get the user's head position to face the chair towards the user
    Vector3D userHeadPosition = GetUsersHeadPosition();
    Vector3D chairPosition = userChair.GetPosition();

    // Calculate the direction from the chair to the user's head position
    // Only considering the x and z components for horizontal rotation
    Vector3 directionToUser = new Vector3(userHeadPosition.x - chairPosition.x, 0, userHeadPosition.z - chairPosition.z);

    // Rotate the chair to face the user, correcting for the initial chair orientation
    Quaternion rotationToFaceUser = Quaternion.LookRotation(directionToUser);
    Quaternion correctedRotation = Quaternion.Euler(0, -90, 0) * rotationToFaceUser; // Adjust for the chair's initial right-facing orientation

    // Convert the corrected Quaternion rotation to Euler angles, then Vector3D type for SetRotation
    Vector3 chairRotationEuler = correctedRotation.eulerAngles;
    Vector3D chairRotation = new Vector3D(chairRotationEuler.x, chairRotationEuler.y, chairRotationEuler.z);
    userChair.SetRotation(chairRotation);
}
